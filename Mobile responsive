Mobile responsive

Neusa font

How it was

What can we do?

mobile first is responsive design

Responsive 

adaptive breaks out when a certain width is achieved then it changes the size

Breakpoints make stuff movei down instead of procent that makes everything small

Max width, that makes it responsie.



Not devices but capabilites, 

Mobile first = content first

we make the content good for small devices, 

RESPONSIVE DESIGN AND PROCESS

Set breakpoint on contents and not resolutions.

See when your design BREAKPOiNTS expands until it looks bad "breaks" that is when you need a breakpoint so it looks good.

Start fromt the bad and then add to that, not the bst in the start casue that is not themmost adaptable




Hover to not have vital stuff there that the mobile device does not support

Fat finger freindly have padding


svg works wel for image scale or 2x 3x for flat design 

Do not load stuff to much in the beginning like images that you need later.

Because people leave the first 5 seconds, at least 75 % of them



PART 2 (Deux)

VIewport define viewport that should use the size of the device instead of showing the whole site.

intial-scale - if it should be zoomed in or not.

<meta name="viewport" content="width=device-width, intial-scale=1.0" />

Normalize styles

Normalize.css load on the first stylesheet you load.


* {
	
		box-sizing:border-box;

	}

	changes the box model in the browser
}
	with normal width takes100% of its parent. + whatever the border is.
	Adding this, you are saying if you have a width, it should contain even the border and padding, that is detracted from it.
	So now you can use 100% width and it is aswell.




fill veiwport heihgt

body, html {
	
	width:100%;
}

take us of the whole viewport height, if you have to support internet explorer 8


felxible media 

img {
	

	max-width:100%
	height:auto;
	//height as same ratio 
}

grow full size of it s parent container, it never becomes bluryy, until it reaches it naturals size



Responsive units

em - Basically the width of one charachter in the current font.
Depended in the context, 

rem - relative to font-size of html element, by default 16 px is the html default size,

1 rem is 16px. 

target pixels 24 / context 16 = result is in REM

24/16 = 1.5rem


caniuse.com to see browsers what you can use.
Which browser that supports a function




New usefull units
viewport units


100vh that is the whole width


vw = equals 1 % of viewport width
vh = 1 % of viewport height

css calc()

nativly built in, that allows to calc values runtime in the browswer

calculate, the result of combiingin different units.

width: calc(100%-20px) it is 100% but you want to take away 20px.


Fluid typography

How to make it all look goood.

DO not be afraid of using big fonts, the further people are from the screen the bigger the font should be.

@media screen and (min-width:700px) {
	
	html {
		font-size=24px
	}
}

All the heading and the text and fonts to increase their size in relation to the screen size.


You use these rems and then the media screen to make it better.

h1 {
	font-size:2rem;
}



45-75 characters per line is the sweet spot of reading.


jjjjjjjjjjjjjjjjjjjjjjjjjjjjjjjjjjjjjjjj



line height:

it should be related to the font-size.


body{
	
	-webkit-font-smoothing: antialiased;
}

It looks crips, makes font thicker but more smoothe

it will look the same as photoshop in the browser, only works with webkit.





Responsive grids






.main, .sidebar {
	
	display:block
}


using media queries to change the float so theboxes are smaller and can go beside each other or under.




Make your grid suit your content.
